# Derivative-Pricing-with-Monte-Carlo-Lattice-and-PDE-Models
This project was developed within the Computational Methods and Machine Learning course of the MAFINRISK master’s program.
It focuses on implementing and comparing multiple numerical techniques for pricing derivative instruments under a non-linear stochastic process.

Overview

The analysis begins with the estimation of model parameters through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), followed by the simulation of the stochastic process using the Euler–Maruyama discretization.
Several pricing methods were then applied and compared in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and numerical stability.

Main Components

MLE parameter estimation for the stochastic differential equation (SDE)

Monte Carlo simulation for European option pricing

Lattice (binomial/trinomial) technique with probability adjustment

Finite-difference PDE approach for numerical solution of option prices

Extension to American and barrier (up-and-out) options

Convergence and stability analysis of the numerical schemes

Key Results

The project highlights the consistency of numerical pricing methods across different frameworks, showing how discretization choices and volatility parameters affect valuation outcomes.
It also demonstrates the link between stochastic modeling, numerical approximation, and derivative pricing in modern quantitative finance.
